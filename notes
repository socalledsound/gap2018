conspiracy -- "truth" -- mapping - equivalancies

graphic notation is an invitation top create equivalencies 
sometimes composer is more explicit, other times less so

you have this data -- what you assign it to is the key choice and a very difficult one

and oftentimes when you make that mapping, or AS you make that mapping the data is transformed, in several ways,
on a mundane level, it often needs to be mapped into a different range, 

look at that in p5.js and then quickly at .map() in js



on a deeper level, it becomes mapped/morphed into something else, because of the new connecitons and associations which are fostered....

so again -- why make these connections/mappings?


BOTH are transformed
