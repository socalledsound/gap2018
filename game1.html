<p>Our first game will really be a collection of games: a theme and several variations.  This can be a book of a poetry, it can be a series of paintings, it can be a collection of marbles that has an accompanying rulebook. </p>

<p>An example would be the to invent several games using balls and cones for the big ramp in the sculpture area.</p>
<p>Another example would be to invent a sculptural object and several games to play using that object.</p>
<p>Or you could make a series of improvisational scores for a group of people.</p>
<p>The interesting question will be: how are these variations related?  How do they inform, expand, challenge each other, and the participants?</p>
<p>Check the links from the first day of class for some game-ish artworks that succesfully explore the the theme and variation model.</p>

<p>theme and variations in classical music could be better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raqOYw5kRdc</p> -->
