I'm sort of unofficially beginning blogging this class today, a little more than halfway into it.
Mostly because I think it's a habit I want to get into.

It's interesting to think about radical costuming, in this political moment, about groups of people who agree to wear alternative garb.  Is it exclusive?  Is that ok?  Is it productive?  Does it matter what the costumes are, etc?

Very sad to see the news about the racist graffitti on campus.  So strange.  

But on the other hand so typical.  People under pressure, insecure people, weak people, have a tendency to resort to attacking others that they perceive as weaker.  They seek to find scapegoats and outsiders.

And of course race is historically the chief card that the ruling class has played against the white middle/lower classes.  In other words, to preserve their own power they have incited racial hatred.  cf.  Barack Obama, black socialist president.

"I'm not your Negro" was an astonishingly eloquent portrait of this dynamic, narrated entirely by quotes delivered in the mid 60's by James Baldwin, quotes which are still entirely topical to this very day.  

"Why did white america invent the nigger in the first place?"  He asks.  "I'm not your nigger.  But if you think I am, then you need to find out why.  And the future of this country depends on that."
